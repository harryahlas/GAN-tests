# Build Multi Channel mp4 Files from wav Stems

*stempeg_build_mp4s.ipynb* is built to run on Colab. It takes as input wav files built  with *demucs_samples.R*. These wav files were run locally and then uploaded to Drive. A better process would be to build the files in Colab entirely.
*demucs__attempt.ipynb* in main folder works except the training has major issues.


### Test writing own data to mp4 with multiple channels
[x] Move 5 files to colab
[x] Copy import code over
[x] Run code
[x] Copy export code over
[x] Run code
[x] Save code locally in new demucs folder

### Write all data to multiple channels
[x] figure out if files need to be in separate folders
[x] if needed, create separate folders
[x] upload train files
[x] upload test files
[x] figure out how to import to colab
[x] figure out how to export to drive
[x] locally, figure out how to make a loop
[x] Run loop
[x] save files
[x] rename stempeg to stempeg_build_mp4s and move to Development/demucs

### Optional Improvements
[ ] A better process would be to build the files in Colab entirely. Start by uploading the raw data and then running *demucs_samples.R* if possible in Colab.
